% What
\noindent We propose a model checker for $\mathtt{KEC_{(m)}}$ and $\mathtt{S5EC_{(m)}}$.
% 
% How
We plan to check the satisfiability of a formula within a model $M$ using the recursive approach we apply when doing it manually. The advantage of this approach is that the checker can show a human how to approach the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a formula within a model.
% 
% Why
This project covers Kripke models and common knowledge.
% 
% Extensions
Although we plan to start with a command line tool, we hope to extend the project with a website which visualizes the model and shows the users the steps taken.
